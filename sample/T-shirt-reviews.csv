Bought this product recently and I must say IT WAS WORTH THE BUY!!!!!,5,Reviewed, XX-LargeColor,Great buy!,"Bought these for my hubby and he loves them. The quality,the comfort he feels and the size was just right. Planning on buying again soon. 😌"
Brady,4,Reviewed, LargeColor,Great,"Ok the reviews did not lie lol, these things really shrink. I ordered a large knowing they would probably shrink, when I received the shirts they fit like a XL but after a wash they fit like a medium which is fine. Good quality, comfortable and lightweight."
Debi,5,Reviewed, XX-LargeColor,Awesome,Husband loves the softness. Fits perfect. Material is great 👍. Looks good in all colors. Length is just what I was looking for. Excellent value.
Terrence B. Schroedle,5,Reviewed, XX-LargeColor,"Very comfortable shirts, if you need large buy XL…","These are very nice shirts, I bought XL first, they fit nice until I washed & dried them, they shrank. I gave the XL to my son and ordered XXL. When I washed them these shrank and fit me perfectly!"
Amazon Customer,3,Reviewed, X-LargeColor,amazingly thin,it's a good thing they're cheap because I can see through the fabric before the first wash. These might be the flimsiest shirt I've ever purchased. There's no way the neck is going to keep its shape. I would only buy these again to use as rags. So you get 3 stars for less than 4 bucks a shirt - any more expensive and they'd be a 2 tops.
Cindy Decker,5,Reviewed, X-LargeColor,Absolutely perfect,"These are a good reliable brand with pockets, unfortunately they are too big. I would like to exchange them for large."
Steve G,5,Reviewed, X-LargeColor,Buy a size up from what you wear,The reviews stating shrinkage are correct. I wear L. But ordered XL and they fit perfectly after washing These are a great buy. Not the thickest material but I would not consider them thin. Good overall quality.
Mr Woodward,5,Reviewed, 3X-LargeColor,Comfortable,"I like the variety color pack and the pocket on the front. I thought I wouldn’t like that but now that I have them, I like the pocket and they are very comfortable I have a very big belly and these 3X shirts. Keep it hidden just right."
Jamie,4,Reviewed, LargeColor,Nice T-Shirts with Pockets,These T-shirts are nice and the material isn't thin. The only problem I have with these are that they fit smaller than regular size T-shirts. I bought medium and should have purchased large. Nice quality made T-shirts.
RDana,5,Reviewed, MediumColor,The high-quality you would expect,"These are the only T-shirts my father will wear. High quality and the must have pocket. They wash well, don’t shrink, hold their color and last for many years. Super happy with this purchase."
Nick,4,Reviewed, MediumColor,Good enough.,"It's a pack of plain various colored Hanes pocket t-shirts you can't really expect much. They're ok quality but I learned 2 lessons from purchasing these shirts before.
1. Order a size up from what you normally wear these shirts WILL SHRINK. They will shrink a decent amount. I learned the hard way the first time.
2. These are not the shirts to wear to work if you work a blue collar type of job it's just not cut out for being stretched or being put through hard work.
3. Don't expect these shirts to last long my first pack that I purchased although those shirts don't fit perfect already have holes around the pocket.
Overall these are decent shirts I don't regret my purchase and you get 6 shirts for a price that's hard to beat."
Alejandro Albornoz,4,Reviewed, MediumColor,Me quedan perfectas / la tela pica un poco,"Se ven muy bien, la talla M me quedo perfecta en los hombros, y tambien de largo y de ancho (soy delgado y mido 1.85m). A pesar de que las lave antes de usar, hacen que me pique el cuerpo un poco si hace calor, no esperaba eso pues dice que son 100% algodon, pero por el precio creo que esta bastante bien"
James R. McCoy,4,Reviewed, 3X-LargeColor,lightweight tees with pockets.,I like these tees as they are very reasonably priced and not so heavy that I sweat so bad.
Lydia,4,Reviewed, LargeColor,A little long,"My fiance was in need of more shirts, and these worked great! They’re super soft, and flattering! The only issue is they were a bit long, and he’s longer in the torso as is, but after one wash, they shrunk enough to fit better. He says they’re breathable and super comfortable. He wears them to church, grad parties, and even under suit jackets sometimes. Some reviews said something about the smell being bad, but I didn’t notice anything bad. Maybe it was just my experience, but it was fine!"
Kent,4,Reviewed, XX-LargeColor,T-Shirts,"The material is a little thin, otherwise a good buy."
Amazon Customer,4,Reviewed, LargeColor,Economical Purchase,Shirts run true to size and great for my construction work. Thin material that breathes. Pocket could be a bit deeper for phone or eye glasses that don’t fall out when leaning over. Two of the shirts have already had a seam come loose.

Good product 😀,4,Reviewed, XX-LargeColor,Shirt sets,Great set comfortable shirts
Design Critic,5,Reviewed, X-LargeColor,Great T-shirts.,"I love these T-shirts, I've bought them several times now. They are comfortable, they last a good long time and hold their shape, I like that they have pockets and are pretty inexpensive. When I have an old T-shirt that develops holes or a sagging neckline, I'm happy to toss it and grab a new one."
Venice,5,Reviewed, SmallColor,Great material,. My baby father loves them fits him perfect
ngawang tsultim,4,Reviewed, SmallColor,Better than expected,Was surprised by the quality and how good they were. Bought a pack and I’ll be buying again in a few years.
CR,5,Reviewed, XX-LargeColor,Very comfortable,"The shirts are roomy and comfortable. I wish the material was a little thicker but for the price, I'm not complaining. It gets the job done."
Amazon Customer,5,Reviewed, X-LargeColor,item is as described and on time.,Item is as described and on time delivery.
Jay,4,Reviewed, LargeColor,will shrink a little,I am kind of between a large and an extra large because I have long arms and a long torso. If you're like me buy the extra large because they shrink a little. I like the shirts.
Book Lover,5,Reviewed, MediumColor,Excellent cotton crew neck T-shirt,These cotton crew neck T-shirts are so soft and comfortable. I love the different colors and the fact that there is no tag in the back. They are definitely longer that regular T-shirts and stay tucked in so much better.
Brian Tamburelli,5,Reviewed, X-LargeColor,Good enough for me.,I'm simple from a small town. I wear blue geans and a T-shirt all the time.😊 I like the comfort and soft cotton.
Publius,4,Reviewed, XX-LargeColor,Odd texture to the cloth,"Stretchy, feels almost double knit.

Not my usual experience with this brand."
Justin,4,Reviewed, LargeColor,Decent tees,"The material seems a little bit on the thinner side.
That being said, I use pocket t shirts for work, as the pocket comes in handy, and I think the value for the dollar is pretty good with these.
Washed and worn a few times and they are currently holding up well. Time will tell regarding their longevity.
Fit is pretty standard and they seem quite breathable.
Overall I would recommend these for their price point.
Hope this helps."
JS,5,Reviewed, MediumColor,Great shirts!,"I bought these shirts and I'm so glad I did.

They are super soft and I am able to wear them to work as well as just relaxing at home.

The heather colors look really good and I have received compliments on the various colors.

So far the quality of them has been outstanding. No frays or lose strings at all.

They fit me perfect and don't make my stomach stick out at all which is nice. The cut is also perfect and sits right at the waist. The sleeves make my arms look good without being too tight.

The functionality of being able to wear them at work or at home relaxing is perfect.

I'm very happy with my purchase!"
M. Broach,5,Reviewed, LargeColor,Soft!,Can’t beat hanes brand!
Justme2013,4,Reviewed, LargeColor,Quality decline for the win!,"If you’re looking for a good simple t-shirt this ain’t it. Hanes T's of the past actually held up to some wear and several dozen launderings. I can tell these won’t. These are the flimsiest, cheapest excuse for a shirt I have ever seen. BUT, I got them to wear at a factory job where it’s always 90°+F . I’d go shirtless if I could; all these things have to do is cover my torso so I can keep my job. In years past, when quality was a thing, it may have been impossible to get such a lightweight shirt new. Thanks to declining standards, I got exactly what I needed!
The 4 stars is because despite my ordering the dark mix pack they threw in a white shirt. I can’t even use it. I basically got shorted a shirt, so they get shorted a star."
Robert H.,4,Reviewed, 3X-LargeColor,Price,For the money you can't beat them
Amazon Customer,4,Reviewed, LargeColor,Not as soft as they used to be.,Tshirts not as soft as they used to be. Fit was good.

cal miller,5,Reviewed, XX-LargeColor,Light weight,Thinner than I expected but fits well
Susan C.,4,Reviewed, MediumColor,Decent for the price,Couldn't find these locally at the moment so I ordered online thinking they would be the same. The size is good but the fabric is not as soft as the ones I have bought in the past even after washing them. Shipping was on time.
James E.,4,Reviewed, X-LargeColor,Lighter weight than normal,"These are good work shirts for me, but they are very light weight. Can’t complain at the cost, but I think paying a little more for the beefy t’s is better"
Amazon Customer,4,Reviewed, XX-LargeColor,Cotton shirts,Fits good I like the pocket on them seems little thin
Fridgitator,4,Reviewed, 3X-LargeColor,"Pockets are a little small, but till useable.",Decent shirts for the price.

CJPRC49,5,Reviewed, XX-LargeColor,Great pocket tees,My husband loves these tees
John Shiplette,5,Reviewed, 3X-LargeColor,I love these,really nice
Bernard Mayet,4,Reviewed, LargeColor,Kinda thin/sheer 1st impression,"While Hanes is normally a quality name brand, this 6 pack of pocket T-Shirts makes me question my purchase. The issue I have is the material these shirts are made of is quite thin. However, if they ""last"" as long as my thicker Jockey pocket T shirts, I would change my rating to 5 stars. However, at the same time, if there wear out quicker, I would change my rating to 2 stars. It's too early to establish a final rating, but my first impression is that they are going to wear out quickly. While you can buy 6 of these shirts for the same price as buying 1 and a half Jockey T Shirts, if they don't last very long, the Jockey shirts may have been the best bargain. I work in T Shirts all day, summer and winter so after a few washings I may write another review."
Reggie Ormeo,5,Reviewed, X-LargeColor,Very Comfortable!,Very Soft And Love The Variety Of Colors!
Alton Jones,5,Reviewed, X-LargeColor,awesome,quality

Toni,5,Reviewed, 3X-LargeColor,Trustworthy brand,Haynes has been such a staple in our home. Colors were vibrant and the fit is excellent.
DCL,3,Reviewed, X-LargeColor,Thin and sags,"I was looking for pocket t-shirts because I had been stuck carrying a heart monitor, which is essentially a cell phone for the monitor. Several brands were similar and had good reviews, so I bought a pack of Gildan, Hanes, and FTL shirts. The Gildan were about twice as heavy as the others and built much stronger. With the phone in the pocket the FTL and Hanes shirts sagged and the neck distorted. The Gildan was fine. The FTL and Hanes shirts were also so thin that you could see the phone right through the pocket and had loose threads here and there. The Gildan was fine and was opaque. Bottom line: buy the Gildan. I will go that route in the future."
Gary Long,5,Reviewed, 3X-LargeColor,great shirts,"I ordered too large a size, but the shirts are good."
Mike Wong,4,Reviewed, LargeColor,comfortable.,Great for indoors or working in yard!

Hoofy,4,Reviewed, X-LargeColor,these are ok,"Good price, seems to be made well. My only complaint is that they aren't soft. I suppose after many washings and dryings= hopefully they soften up a bit."

Súper recomendados por su calidad y precio,5,Reviewed, LargeColor,Calidad,Me encanta para combinar con cualquier atuendo sin duda volvería a comprar
beetle_X,5,Reviewed, MediumColor,Decent quality. Size runs a little small.,From a price point you can't beat these shirts. Size ran a little small for me.
J. Paul,4,Reviewed, MediumColor,Great everyday shirts,Great shirts to knock around with. They are thin enough for warm weather and are inexpensive so you don't have to worry about them. They do not have to be worn as undershirts either. Size is accurate: I weigh 135 and am 5'6 and size M was perfect. I like that they have chest pockets too. You can't go wrong with these inexpensive Hanes shirts.
angelica,4,Reviewed, X-LargeColor,Shrinks in dryer,My husband is 6 foot tall and he likes them until they shrunk in the dryer. I would recommend to air dry them on a hanger than the dryer. Other then that they are good shirts for men
Meg,4,Reviewed, SmallColor,These feel awful at first,After a couple washes and fabric softener my husband likes them
Hector,4,Reviewed, LargeColor,Comodas,"El paquete llegó en buenas condiciones. Son cómodas, algo grandes (largas) y la tela es un poco fina para mi gusto, pero en general todo bien."
Jackoline Crosby,4,Reviewed, 3X-LargeColor,Love these,These are Hubby’s favorite Tees. Very comfy
Richard,4,Reviewed, XX-LargeColor,T shirts,Great fit. Made well. But they did shrink slightly after washing.
Amazon Customer,3,Reviewed, 3X-LargeColor,Not the Hanes quality you're used to...,"I bought these for loungewear. But, being Hanes, I expected a properly made shirt. I was quite underwhelmed with the majority of shirts in my pack. The seams in the most of the arms made me think it was a pack of irregulars. Some pockets had lining material that escaped the seams. They work for my purpose, but are not what I expect from the brand or the price. I'll look elsewhere next time."
Phillip D. Johnson,5,Reviewed, LargeColor,fit,thin material but cooler
Mr Black,4,Reviewed, XX-LargeColor,What's to say.,Just a little pricey for me but still have to.
Larry D Barnett,5,Reviewed, LargeColor,My old standard,This brand has been my go to for years now. Just don’t understand why it’s so hard to get the color I want. Selling in mixed color packs just doesn’t make sense to me?
Tom Blak,5,Reviewed, X-LargeColor,Good light summer shirts to work in,Great fit good for working in summer heat .
Dennis,5,Reviewed, XX-LargeColor,nice,"fits well, nice. that is all I have to say."
cody soileau,4,Reviewed, XX-LargeColor,Dad liked them,I thought they were as advertised and my dad also liked them. He said size is true as advertised as well
JB,4,Reviewed, 3X-LargeColor,Great,"These are comfortable. I like the pocket and the size etc printed on the cloth so it's tagless. They are thinner material than expected, but that's actually good in the heat."
Blair,5,Reviewed, X-LargeColor,These are so soft,These are so soft and comfortable . I have bought several packs for family members also.
CEB,5,Reviewed, X-LargeColor,Love pocket shirt!,Pocket shirt is terrific. Washes well. As described.
Greg J,5,Reviewed, 10Color,True to size. Great quality,"No tags on shirts, which is a simple but great positive. Great color, great quality, and the fabric feels good. True to size and the cut looks great."
2Tall,5,Reviewed, 5Color,Good quality for the price.,I like the different color assortments that they offer. For the price the shirts are nice and soft they seem very true to their size and are comfortable. I would say it's a medium lightweight shirt that has a little bit of stretch in it and they seem durable so far.
jonathan,4,Reviewed, 6Color,Sleeves and tail is short.,Good quality. Not itchy. The sleeves and tail were shorter than expected. The fit is tighter than needed. This is great of I were getting there for under shirts but this was too be my daily wear collection. If you are not buying for undershirts buy a size bigger. I have small and wish for medium. I'll still use them the fit isn't terrible
Bigben,5,Reviewed, 5Color,Nice shirts,These have a nice feel and are practical being so cheap. After two washings they shrunk a small amount so keep that in mind. Have not seen colors fade but even if they did that isn’t important to me. I’ll buy more when these are past their prime.
Diego Jimenez,5,Reviewed, 5Color,Comfortable,"Very comfortable shirts. The colors are great, got medium size and they fit perfectly. Material is also great quality, very versatile have used for all different kind of activities including jogging working out and every day activities. Very light weight and when wet cannot see through. I highly recommend I will be purchasing again."
Balen,5,Reviewed, 6Color,Great daily undershirts,"These shirts fit well and are not thin so they feel nice to wear as undershirts or as regular shirts. After repeated washes they do tend to shrink, so if you are normally a men's M it first comes a tad oversize for a typical M and then after a wash or two shrinks to essentially a regular size M. After repeated washes over a year or two, they do quickly fade, but as they are inexpensive can always order another pack"
Lance,4,Reviewed, 6Color,Neck size is not consistant,"Quality is a bit iffy on these. Each shirt was inspected prior to washing. These are not preshrunk, and will go to more of the standard size when placed in dryer with warm air.

Neck opening is larger than expected for the size. I have other shirts from Gildan with graphics on them and collars fit close. The collars on these feel like I purchased a size up. Two shirts developed holes in around seams after drying. Shirts were placed on delicate cycle by themselves.

Shirts are lightweight without being thin as some other brands. Overall these appear to be decent shirts. I took off a star due to the neck sizing, and the couple holes that might have been from weak threads. I mended these placed and have not had any other issues."
Kris,5,Reviewed, 6Color,They made a few changes,"I have been buying this brand of tank tops and T-shirts for years and I've always been happy with them that's why I keep using them. I just bought a pack of black T-shirts and I noticed a couple of differences since the last time I purchased them. First of all they used to have no tag, now they have a tag in the back of the crew. I prefer the no tag option. The other difference I noticed is that the arms are not cut as tight as they used to be. I personally like a snug fit around the biceps. Overall, I recommend this company even with the changes."
Andrew,4,Reviewed, 6Color,Good undershirts,"I was looking to buy some new plain white undershirts for work. I bought these along with a Fruit of the Loom Eversoft 6-pack to compare. The overall fit was similar between both brands as far as sizing and collar go. The Fruit of the Loom shirts felt a little bit higher quality as the cotton was softer and a touch thicker, but the stitching on the shoulder/sleeve seam was done in an awkward spot and therefore made the fit of the shirt look a little off. The Gildan shirts didn’t have that problem as the seam was where I expected it to be at the top of my shoulder. Due to that, the Gildan shirts won out for me, but I wouldn’t recommend these as a regular t-shirt to wear on its own as they wrinkle easily and are on the thinner side. Perfect as an undershirt though."
Reflected,4,Reviewed, 5Color,Nice shirts for money,For the money these seem like a deal. I've bought all the cheap brands through the years and these are quality in that group. I use them for house shirts. But they run big and even after washing and drying on the hottest setting and still I was swimming in them still. I have autism and need tight fitting clothes for sensory input. Medium would probably be too small. Still a good shirt.
Dan Eljach,5,Reviewed, 5Color,True to size,Was looking for some casual around the house shirts and these were perfect. They are not too thick so that you’re not sweating when completing tasks but they as also soft and comfortable. Would buy again
Big B in Da Washington hood,5,Reviewed, 5Color,Gildan is our 'Go-To' brand for shirts for dye-sub test before we make dozens up on heavy weights...,"Don't get me wrong here....Gildan is EXCELENT clothing...They are lighter weight than Amazon Essentials, but they last as long and so we trust the results we get from testing before we drop a ton of coin on heavy weight shirts people gravitate to over light weight ones....However I can tell you I have a TON of KEWL shirts I wear constantly in my production laser shop, custom car fab shop and at race tracks.....These are High Quality just light weight....

I still give them
Two Thumbs Up -- Strongly Recommend rating!!!!"
J.K. Mendicino,5,Reviewed, 5Color,Excellent shirts.,I've recently put on a ton of muscle and needed bigger t-shirts. XD These feel great. They're also easy to wash and slip into so I'm a happy customer.

Brian Baker,5,Reviewed, 6Color,"Excellent quality, long lasting!","These shirts are my favorite! They are very high quality, soft, I love that they are tagless, and last years and years before needing to be replaced."
DaveyJones,5,Reviewed, 5Color,Fit fit,These are my fave t’s. The fit is perfect. Sleeves just the right length to show enough bicep. I won’t buy anything else. Tagless variety are the best.
